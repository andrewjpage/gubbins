== Prep work ==
As listed in the dependancies section below, you need
 * Python 2.7.

== Included external applications ==
The following applications are included and will compile and be used automatically, 
however you should try installing them yourself because you can get substantial
performance increases by choosing a makefile which is more appropriate for your system.
* FastTree (>=2.1.4) http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/,
* FASTML (2.02) http://fastml.tau.ac.il/,
* RAxML (>=7.2.8, the full version) http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html, and

Finally, the raxmlHPC binary should be named "raxmlHPC".


== Installing for Linux (64bit) ==
$ ./configure
$ su -
$ make
$ make install
$ cd python
$ python setup.py install


== Installing for other systems ==
$ autoreconf -i --force
$ ./configure
$ su -
$ make
$ make install
$ cd python
$ python setup.py install


To run the script with all of the default bundled executables and bundled test data
$ cd python
$ scripts/run_gubbins gubbins/tests/data/multiple_recombinations.aln


To run the script anywhere you must first install the external dependancies yourself by copying the executables below into your PATH:
external/standard-RAxML/raxmlHPC
external/fastml/programs/fastml/fastml
external/fasttree/FastTree

Then you can run this from any directory:
$ run_gubbins my_alignment.fa


On Linux, you should ensure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH and that
/usr/local/lib (or /usr/local/lib64 on 64bit machines) are in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

== Installing into a specific user directory ==

It is common to want to build and install an application so that it is not
system-wide and is only available to your user.  On a Linux system this is
generally achieved by installing into the .local directory in your home
directory.

$ ./configure --prefix=~/.local
$ make
$ make install

On Linux, you should ensure that ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH and that
~/.local/lib (or ~/.local/lib64 on 64bit machines) are in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

If you are in the situation where your home directory is mounted over NFS (or
similar) and shared between multiple Linux distros (for example, 32bit Debian on
a cluster and 64bit Ubuntu on a desktop) then installing per-user in this manner
is probably not a good idea.

== Dependancies ==

If these applications are not available in your PATH, less efficient ones will be used:
FastTree (>=2.1.4) http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/
RAxML (>=7.2.8, the full version) http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html
FASTML (2.02) http://fastml.tau.ac.il/

== Python ==
Python 2.7 is required

These Python packages must be in your PYTHONPATH or will be automatically 
installed:
Biopython (>=1.59)
DendroPy  (>=3.11.1)
ReportLab (>= 2.5)

If you get errors from Biopython make sure you have the following packages installed (as named by Debian/Ubuntu):
python-dev
python-reportlab
python-numpy
python-support

== Running the Python wrapper ==

There is a Python wrapper script that automates some of the preparatory work
that is necessary to run Gubbins.

To run the application:
run_gubbbins.py my_alignment.aln
